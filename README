Make sure firefox is installed

After cloning the project, cd into the directory.

Run 'make install' to install the program 

Run: 'search my search query' to launch a google search in firefox

Run: 'search -b chromium-browser my search query' to launch a google search in chromium


If you want to run the command with "g" instead of "search" add to your bash.rc

	g() {
	    /usr/bin/search "$@*" &
#	    exit  # close terminal 
	}
