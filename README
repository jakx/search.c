Make sure firefox is installed

After cloning the project, cd into the directory.

Run 'make install' to install the program 

Run: 'search my search query' to launch a google search in firefox


I wanted my terminal to close after running my search so I created a function in my bash.rc

	g() {
	    /usr/bin/search "$*" &
	    exit
	}
